# Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform – Scalable Tenant-Based System

## Overview
This project is a **multi-tenant SaaS platform** designed to serve multiple organizations from a single, scalable codebase while ensuring **strict data isolation, security, and performance**. The system allows businesses to onboard quickly, manage their own users, and operate independently within a shared infrastructure.

## Problem
Many SaaS products struggle with:
- Poor tenant isolation and data leakage risks  
- Complex onboarding for new organizations  
- Difficulty scaling as tenants grow  
- Lack of flexibility in roles, permissions, and customization  

## Solution
I designed and built a **robust multi-tenant architecture** that:
- Supports multiple organizations (tenants) with isolated data
- Provides secure tenant-aware authentication and authorization
- Enables role-based access control per tenant
- Scales efficiently without duplicating infrastructure

The platform was engineered to support **enterprise use cases, SaaS monetization, and long-term growth**.

## Key Features
- Multi-tenant architecture with secure data isolation
- Tenant-based user management and role permissions
- Organization onboarding and tenant provisioning
- Admin dashboards for tenant and system-level management
- Subscription-ready architecture
- Scalable REST APIs with tenant-aware middleware

## Tech Stack
### Frontend
- React / Next.js
- Responsive, dashboard-focused UI

### Backend
- Node.js
- REST APIs with tenant-aware logic
- Authentication with JWT and RBAC

### Databases
- PostgreSQL / MySQL
- Tenant-level data isolation strategies

### Cloud & Infrastructure
- AWS (cloud-ready deployment)
- Docker-based containerization
- CI/CD pipelines

## Architecture Highlights
- Single codebase serving multiple tenants
- Secure tenant resolution and request scoping
- Scalable database schema design
- Optimized for high concurrency and performance

## Impact & Results
- Enabled multiple organizations to operate independently on one platform
- Reduced infrastructure costs through shared resources
- Improved scalability and maintainability
- Built a strong foundation for SaaS subscriptions and growth

## My Role
- Multi-tenant system architecture and design
- Backend development and API implementation
- Database schema and isolation strategy
- Frontend dashboard development
- Deployment, scaling, and optimization
