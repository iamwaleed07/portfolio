## Overview

Development of a comprehensive cloud cost management platform with AI-driven monitoring and analytics. The platform enables organizations to track cloud resource usage, identify inefficiencies, and implement automated strategies for cost reduction. Frontend interfaces were built with Next.js for responsive dashboards, while Python and FastAPI powered backend services and AI analytics.

## Key Features

- **AI Cost Monitoring**: Leveraged open-source AI models to track cloud usage patterns and provide predictive insights for cost savings.
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Integrated AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud APIs to aggregate usage and cost data into a single dashboard.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Built responsive Next.js interfaces to visualize costs, trends, and AI-driven recommendations in real-time.
- **Automated Alerts & Reports**: Implemented backend logic with FastAPI to send automated alerts, summaries, and suggestions to optimize cloud resources.
- **Cost Management Tools**: Provided users with actionable tools to schedule, limit, or optimize resources directly from the platform.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For AI model integration, data processing, and backend logic.
- **FastAPI**: For building scalable and efficient REST APIs.
- **Next.js**: For frontend dashboards and real-time visualization.
- **Open-Source AI Models**: For predictive analytics and cost optimization insights.
- **Cloud APIs**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud integration for multi-cloud monitoring.

## Challenges and Learnings

Balancing real-time cost monitoring with large-scale cloud data aggregation was a key challenge. Optimizing API calls to multiple cloud providers while maintaining performance required careful backend architecture design. Integrating AI for predictive insights taught valuable lessons in combining machine learning models with production-grade web applications.

## Outcome

The platform now provides organizations with clear visibility into their cloud expenses, actionable AI-driven recommendations, and automated cost optimization workflows. This has resulted in measurable cost savings, better resource allocation, and improved operational efficiency for cloud-dependent businesses.
